**Pricing Strategy Under Demand & Capital Constraints**

A Revenue, Forecast & Risk-Aware Pricing Intelligence Framework

⚠️ This project is a simulation-based strategic pricing framework created for demonstration purposes.
It does not represent real company data.

📌 Project Overview

This repository presents a modular pricing intelligence pipeline designed to transform raw demand data into structured, risk-aware pricing decisions.

Instead of asking:

“Can we increase prices?”

This framework asks:

Where can we increase prices safely?

What is the expected revenue impact?

What is the forecast-adjusted downside risk?

How should pricing strategy adapt across regions and categories?

How do we translate elasticity into operational guidance?

This is not just an elasticity notebook.
It is a structured pricing decision system.

🎯 Business Context

Organizations often increase prices to protect margins. However:

Demand may contract

Revenue may decline

Forecast uncertainty may amplify risk

Inventory planning may destabilize

Promotional leverage may shift

This project builds a systematic approach to answer:

Which regions/categories are safe for margin expansion?

Where is volume protection critical?

What is the optimal balance between revenue growth and risk exposure?

How should pricing differ across portfolio segments?

🧠 Methodology

1️⃣ Data Preparation

Category-level demand aggregation

Regional segmentation (US, EU, APAC, TR)

Promotion-adjusted normalization

Baseline revenue construction


2️⃣ Demand Forecasting


Forecast baseline demand under stable price assumptions.

Purpose:

Establish expected volume trajectory

Provide baseline for simulation

Enable forecast-adjusted risk analysis


3️⃣ Elasticity Estimation


Log-log regression model:

%ΔQ = β × %ΔP

Where:

β = price elasticity coefficient

R² = explanatory strength

Elasticity Classification:

|β| < 0.3 → Low sensitivity

0.3 – 0.7 → Moderate sensitivity

0.7 → High sensitivity


4️⃣ Pricing Scenario Simulation


Three structured strategies:

🔴 Aggressive

Higher price increases

Margin expansion focus

Elevated volume risk

🟡 Balanced

Moderate increases

Revenue optimization

Controlled risk

🟢 Conservative

Minimal increase

Volume preservation

Operational stability

For each scenario:

Adjust price

Apply elasticity-driven demand shift

Recalculate revenue

Estimate volume loss

Quantify risk exposure


5️⃣ Revenue Engine


Revenue Formula:

Revenue = Adjusted Price × Adjusted Quantity

Quantity Adjustment:

New Quantity = Base Quantity × (1 + Elasticity × Price Change%)

This allows pre-execution revenue simulation.


6️⃣ Forecast Risk Layer


Forecast uncertainty is incorporated to detect:

Downside revenue exposure

High volatility segments

Elasticity × Forecast interaction risk

This step ensures pricing decisions are not made in isolation from demand uncertainty.


7️⃣ Operational Risk Translation


Elasticity + Forecast Risk → Strategic Signal

Elasticity Level	Operational Signal
Low	Margin expansion zone
Moderate	Monitor & optimize
High	Volume protection required

This converts statistical output into executive language.


8️⃣ Decision Layer


The final layer integrates:

Revenue delta

Volume contraction

Elasticity sensitivity

Forecast risk

Portfolio exposure

Outputs:

Recommended pricing strategy

Risk classification

Region-category prioritization

This is the strategic recommendation engine.

📈 Key Insights (Simulation Results)


APAC Electronics shows strong margin expansion potential.

US Fashion demonstrates high elasticity — aggressive pricing reduces revenue.

EU exhibits strong promotional responsiveness.

Turkey requires volume-protection strategy.

Revenue does not always increase with price hikes.

Balanced strategy maximizes stability-adjusted revenue.



⚖ Scenario Comparison
Strategy	Revenue Impact	Volume Risk	Stability
Aggressive	High variance	High	Low
Balanced	Optimized	Moderate	High
Conservative	Stable	Low	Very High

Balanced selected as optimal under simulation constraints.


📊 Strategic Principles Derived


Pricing must be elasticity-aware.

Uniform global price strategy is inefficient.

Forecast risk must inform pricing intensity.

Portfolio-level optimization outperforms isolated adjustments.

Analytics must translate into decision logic.
